## WebSite
 == 3 == (made in jolof)[https://madeinjolof.com/] : The challenge of the website was to create a shipping plugin and the creation of a payment plugin.
-  My role is to analyse and implement an algo so as to achieve the task requested very often during a sprint.

Well, I was involved in a maintenance and feature release mission for an e-commerce site where the payment process was not working and had to be solved in a 5 days sprint. I proceeded by analysing the code for 3 to 4 hours and then reviewed the documentation of the api to be used so that I could find the problem and consequently write an adapted algo; Thus I delivered the feature within the deadline.

During a sprint I was not in objective due to the loss of morale following the move I was making in addition to a very critical colleague. To be able to manage the emotions and keep the good cohesion I told the college that his behaviour was unpleasant and that for the respect of the work he should stop and know that all the time one is not at the top of his form.
